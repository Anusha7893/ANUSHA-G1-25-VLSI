## Overall Learning 

During my tenure at Sure Trust, I gained hands-on experience in Verilog, SystemVerilog, UVM, DFT and PD concepts through structured training and practical projects.
This experience strengthened my understanding of digital design and verification methodologies, improved my analytical and problem-solving skills, and provided exposure to industry-relevant workflows.

</div>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1: Vending Machine Controller</h3>
<p>
  Designed and implemented a Vending Machine Controller IP as part of an integrated VLSI front-end design and verification project.
The design supports APB-based configuration, multiple operation modes, and parameterized item and currency handling.
Developed using Verilog/SystemVerilog,UVM, following FSM-based control and industry-oriented VLSI design practices.
